# strawberry_mortality_project
In my statistical consulting senior project class, we used data from the California Strawberry Commission to answer two main research questions. This was a group project, however I was heavily involved in the statistical and analytical aspect of this project. This project was done in JMP. I have also included our Memo, Memo slides, and individual Consulting debrief.
